### About Us
- We are a dedicated group of innovators on a mission to provide you the user the power to fight for your privacy laws and data by giving you th eability to summarize and provide insights about user agreements 

### Mission 
- In a world where big tech and many other companies misuse user data without them even knowing, we plan to use this platform to inform and educate users what they are signing up for when agreeing to user agreements 

### Vision 
- Our vision is that this platform we develop will allow users to get educated and be more cautious when agreeing to terms and services and become more concious about how vauable their user data is and encouurage them to take control of it. 
- Eventually we envision a world where people will be able to agree and disagree to specific things in user agreements instead of agreeing to all of the terms on the agreements.
