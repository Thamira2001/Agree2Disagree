       "* **Data Sharing:** Text 2 accurately states that Apple does not sell user data for marketing purposes.\n",
       "* **Data Protection:** Text 2 accurately mentions Apple's use of security measures and special protections for children.\n",
       "* **Cookies:** Text 2 accurately describes the purpose of cookies and the option to disable them.\n",
       "* **International Data Transfers:** Text 2 accurately mentions data transfers to other countries and Apple's compliance with data transfer laws.\n",
       "* **Contacting Apple:** Text 2 accurately outlines the options for contacting Apple with questions or complaints.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Omissions:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Specific Data Collection:** Text 2 fails to mention the specific types of data collected within each category, such as the details of \"Device Information\" (e.g., browser type, device serial number) or \"Usage Data\" (e.g., browsing history, search history, app launches).\n",
       "* **Legal Basis for Processing:** Text 2 does not mention the legal basis for data processing, such as consent, contract fulfillment, legitimate interests, or legal obligations.\n",
       "* **Data Sharing Details:** Text 2 lacks detail regarding the specific types of third parties Apple shares data with (e.g., service providers, partners, developers, publishers) and the specific purposes for sharing (e.g., processing transactions, providing services, fraud prevention).\n",
       "* **Data Retention:** Text 2 omits information about Apple's data retention policies and the criteria for determining retention periods.\n",
       "* **Personalized Ads:** Text 2 does not explain the details of Apple's advertising platform, including the option to disable personalized ads and the use of the Advertising Identifier.\n",
       "* **Data Control:** Text 2 does not mention that the Apple entity controlling personal data may differ depending on the user's location.\n",
       "* **Global Privacy Standards:** Text 2 does not mention Apple's compliance with the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPRs) System and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System.\n",
       "* **Complaint Resolution:** Text 2 does not mention Apple's commitment to responding to privacy inquiries within seven days and taking steps to address negative impacts.\n",
